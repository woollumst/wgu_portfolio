Introduction

    For this project, you will create a personal portfolio website to demonstrate your ability to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and resolve software problems in web development environments. You will create three HTML pages: a résumé, a cover letter, and a career goals page. As you make your website, you will use one external style sheet for the design and layout of your site. A zip file should be used to upload the personal portfolio.

    You will write your own HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code—no frameworks will be allowed. Do not use online media links—all image, audio, and video files must be stored locally with your code.

    Your submission should include:

    •   3 HTML files: resume.html, cover-letter.html, and career-goals.html

    •   1 external CSS file: master.css or style.css

    •   At least 1 image file (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, or .gif)

    •   1 audio file (.mp3 or .wav)

    •   1 video file (.mp4, .mov, or .mpeg)

Requirements

    It is recommended that you compress your required files into a single archive file (.zip, .rar, .tar, or .7z) named using your last name (e.g., smith_portfolio.zip).
